The scripts i'm using for my undergraduate research about open source repositories

*Autoclone iterates over the pandas dataframe for the URL of the repositories and their names and automatically git clones them <br>
*Forkchecker makes requests to the Github API to check if the github repositories in this dataset are forks, more info on the script in a comment<br>
*Whoareyou iterates over the pandas for domain names in order to indentify the organizations that own the email domains on the source dataset<br>
<br>
Probably more to come soon
